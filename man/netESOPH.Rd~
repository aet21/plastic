data(net13Jun12)
}
\description{
Adjacency matrix describing a curated PPI network derived from Pathway
Commons on the 13th Jun 2012, containing over 8000 proteins. Proteins
have been annotated to the genes (Entrez gene ID) they encode. Diagonal
entries are 0. Other entries are zero or 1 if an interaction has been
reported. Please see references for detailed construction of the PPI network.
