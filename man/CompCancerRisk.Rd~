\title{Computation of Cancer Risk score}
\usage{
CompCancerRisk(tfa.m, pheno.v, thDTFA = "BF")
}
\arguments{
\item{tfa.m}{The TFA-matrix defined over tissue-specific TFs (rows) and cells (columns)}

\item{pheno.v}{A phenotype integer vector for the cells, with normal cells indexed as 0,
preneoplastic cells indexed with 1, and with all other disease stages
indexed with increasing positive integers larger than 1, i.e. with higher
integers the more advanced the disease stage is. Invasive cancer is assumed to be
the largest integer. Note that in order to compute a Cancer Risk Score, it is
necessary to include cells from an invasive cancer state.}

\item{thDTFA}{The significance threshold for defining differentially active TFs.
By default this is Bonferroni-adjusted P<0.05, but can be numeric
in which case the provided value is used.}
}
\value{
A list with the following elements

risk
The cancer-risk score of all preneoplastic cells, computed by correlation
similarity in TFA-space to cancer cells, using only TFs that are significantly
inactivated in preneoplastic cells compared to normal cells.

riskTip
The cancer-risk score of all preneoplastic cells, computed by correlation
similarity in TFA-space to the cancer and cancer-free tip points, as inferred
using Diffusion Maps on the full TFA-matrix.

dmap
The diffusion map object returned by applying Diffusion Maps to the TFA-matrix.

dc
The diffusion component matrix with the number of components estimated
via RMT.

transM
The Markov transition matrix.

root
The index of the root cell.

tipC
The index of the cancer-fate tip point, as inferred using Diffusion Maps.

tipN
The index of the cancer-free fate tip point, as inferred using Diffusion Maps.
}
\description{
This function takes the output from CompTFIL and estimates a cancer-risk score
for each preneoplastic cell.
