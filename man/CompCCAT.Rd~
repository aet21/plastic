\title{Correlation of Connectome And Transcriptome}
\usage{
CompCCAT(exp.m, ppiA.m)
}
\arguments{
\item{exp.m}{A scRNA-Seq data matrix with rows labeling genes and columns 
labeling single cells and with rownames annotated to a gene-identifier
identical to that used in the \code{ppiA.m} argument. scRNA-Seq data matrix
should have undergone prior QC to remove poor quality cells and each cell
normalized by library size. If data has not been log-transformed, the
function will log2-transform with a pseudocount of +1.}

\item{ppiA.m}{The adjacency matrix of a user-given PPI network with rownames and 
colnames labeling genes (same gene identifier as in \code{exp.m}). Diagonal
entries should be zero and the number of genes in the network should be large,
i.e. at least over 8000, to ensure a reasonably large overlap of genes with
those in the expression data matrix.}
}
\value{
\item{CCAT}{The estimated CCAT values as a vector.}
}
\description{
This function leverages Pearson correlation between gene expresion level
and gene connectome derived from PPI network to fastly estimate signaling
entropy rate.
